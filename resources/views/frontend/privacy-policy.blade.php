                <p>We will use and process personal information solely for the purposes for which it was initially collected, unless we reasonably believe there is a need to use it for a different yet compatible reason. In the event we intend to use personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will inform the relevant data subjects and provide an explanation of the legal basis that permits us to do so.</p> 
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-0 heading-title text-primary">5. Is the provision of personal data mandatory?</h3>   
                <p>While we respect decisions by data subjects not to share personal data, please be aware that there may be limitations in our ability to accommodate such choices.  In particular, we are unable to enrol you in any of our Courses unless you open account and thus provide us with Profile Information.  Furthermore, it would be impossible for us to deliver our Courses and discharge our obligations pursuant to the TOU if you do not upload your assignments or participate in the exams or the assessment associated with that particular course.</p> 
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-0 heading-title text-primary">6. What about data concerning third parties? Are there any additional obligations or duties?</h3> 
                <p>To safeguard privacy and ensure that we comply with our legal obligatiosn, we require that you only provide personal data that pertains directly to yourself.</p>  
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-0 heading-title text-primary">7. Do we collect special categories of data?</h3> 
                <p>Under the GDPR, personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation is deemed to be “special categories of personal data” and require a higher level of protection.  We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information. We have in place appropriate safeguards which we are required by law to maintain when processing such data.</p>
                <p>We do not collect any such special category of personal data.</p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-0 heading-title text-primary">8. Do we collect data related to criminal convictions and offences? </h3>

                <p>We will share personal data with third parties where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the relationship with our clients, and as otherwise provided hereunder.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we will also share your personal data as follows:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Lecturers and e-mentors - Your personal data may be shared with lecturers and e-mentors, including those who are not our employees but third-party contractors, who are involved in delivering the Courses you enrol in and administering part of your experience with us. This sharing facilitates personalised guidance, monitors your progress, and enables effective communication.</li>
                    <li>Anti-cheating tools and procedures – We share relevant personal data with third-party service providers that operate anti-cheating tools for various assessments, including live exams. For live exams, data such as registration details, activity logs, and random screenshots taken from the participant’s webcam are shared in real-time with proctoring services to ensure the integrity and security of the examinations. This live data sharing is critical for immediate detection and response to any potential academic dishonesty. Additionally, for other types of assessments, we may share similar data to facilitate ongoing monitoring and uphold our academic honesty policies. This comprehensive approach helps maintain the integrity of all assessments conducted within our educational framework.</li>
                    <li>Third-party service providers – from time to time, and always subject to us complying in full with Article 28 GDPR, we engage a number of third parties to provide us with certain services.  In doing so, certain types of personal data may be required to be provided to such third-party service providers.  These include third parties providing legal advice, audit, payment services and gateways, banking services,  sales and marketing, customer support, AML and sanction screening & IT services;</li>

                    <li>A prospective buyer or any of its advisors, where relevant, in the course of a due diligence exercise or as part of a corporate transaction.  In this situation we will, so far as possible, share anonymised data with the other parties before the transaction completes.</li>

Where permitted, or unless to do so would prejudice the prevention or detection of a crime, we will direct any such request to you or notify you before responding.</p>
                <p>Prior to sharing data with a third-party service provider, we require them to commit in implementing appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-0 heading-title text-primary">10. Is the information transferred outside of the EEA?</h3> 
                <p>Currently, the majority of the personal data we use and process is hosted in Malta and the European Economic Area (EEA).  It is however possible that personal data will be made available or otherwise processed outside of the EUEEA, namely when we engage third-party contractors.  In fact, currently certain technical support services are provided by a trusted third-party vendor based in India.  In the provision of such technical support services, this trusted third-party vendor may be required to access or otherwise process personal data.</p>
                <p>When we engage third-party vendors based outside the EEA, we will take adequate measures to ensure that personal data is safeguarded to the same standards as it would have been if processed in the EU, by relying on one of the following:</p>

                    <li>Right of access (subject access request) - This right allows data subjects to request and obtain confirmation on whether we are processing their personal data. Data subjects can also access details about the processing and receive a copy of the data being held.</li>
                    <li>Right of rectification – data subjects have the right to request that we correct any inaccuracies or incomplete personal data held about them.</li>
                    <li>Right of erasure – In terms of this right, commonly known as the "Right to be Forgotten," data subjects can request the deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances, particularly when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.</li>
                    <li>Right of restriction – data subjects can request the limitation of the processing of their personal data in specific situations. This right is relevant, for instance, when the data subject is contesting the accuracy of the data, or the processing is deemed unlawful.</li>
                    <li>Right to object - This right enables the data subjects to object to the processing of their personal data, including profiling, for reasons related to their particular situation</li>

                </ol>
                <li>In those occasions where we have indicated that we are basing our processing on our legitimate interest, please note that in terms of Article 21 GDPR, data subjects have the right to object to that processing.</li>
                <li>Where the legal basis of processing is based solely on the data subject’s consent, the data subjects may withdraw such consent at any time by notifying us accordingly.  This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of processing based on consent before such withdrawal.</li>
                <li>For more information about these rights and how to exercise them (when we are acting in our capacity as data controllers), kindly contact us on the contact details set out hereunder.</li>
                <p></p>

                <p><u>Automated Multiple-Choice Exam Marking: </u> Certain exams consist of multiple-choice questions, where answers are evaluated solely through automated means without human intervention. This process is necessary for the performance of our contract with you. By agreeing to the terms, you also provide your explicit consent for this automated evaluation. If you believe there has been an error in your marking, please contact us, and we will arrange for a human reassessment of your results.</p>
                <p><u>Turnitin for Plagiarism Detection: </u>We use Turnitin, a tool powered by AI, to check for plagiarism. However, if your work exceeds the plagiarism threshold, it will be reviewed by a human. As this process includes human oversight, it is not considered fully automated under Article 22 GDPR, and the provisions of this article do not apply.</p>
                <p>We are committed to deploying technology responsibly and ensuring your rights are respected in all automated or partially automated processes. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us.</p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-0 heading-title text-primary">13. For how long do we retain personal data?</h3>
                <p>The length of time for which we hold personal data depends on a number of factors, such as regulatory rules and any legal requirements.

                <p>Privacy and data protection is a two-way street, and while we strive to uphold it diligently, the active participation of everyone is crucial.
