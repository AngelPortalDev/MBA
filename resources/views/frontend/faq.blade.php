                                    MQF stands for Malta Qualifications Framework. It is a national qualifications framework used in Malta to structure qualifications and ensure consistency and quality in education. It serves as a reference for understanding and comparing the levels of different qualifications within the Maltese educational system and across various fields of study. The MQF aims to facilitate lifelong learning and recognize all forms of learning, including formal, non-formal, and informal education. <br><br>
                                    The MQF is structured into eight levels, each representing a unique stage of learning. These levels are about acquiring knowledge and developing skills and competencies. Each level is a stepping stone, leading to the next and reflecting the increasing complexity and depth of knowledge required. <br><br>
                                    EQF stands for European Qualifications Framework. It is a common European reference framework designed to make national qualifications more readable and understandable across different countries and systems within Europe. It acts as a translation device to help educational institutions, employers, and individuals compare qualifications across European countries. EQF promotes greater transparency, mobility, and lifelong learning across Europe. <br><br>
                                    The alignment of the MQF with the EQF not only ensures that Malta's qualifications are easily understood and respected throughout Europe but also fosters enhanced educational and professional opportunities for its citizens. This alignment provides individuals with a clear roadmap for career development, showing progression routes through various levels of education and training. Moreover, it enhances the global recognition of qualifications, opening up worldwide opportunities for E-Ascencia and Ascencia Malta graduates.

                                    ECTS stands for European Credit Transfer System. ECTS credits measure how much work is needed to finish a course or program. Each course in a program has a certain number of ECTS credits assigned to it. These credits show how much time and effort is required to complete the course, including attending lectures, doing assignments, and taking exams. <br><br>
                                    One ECTS credit equals about 25 to 30 hours of work. So, if a course is worth 3 ECTS credits, you can expect to spend about 75 to 90 hours on it. A full academic year is usually worth 60 ECTS credits. This means that students are expected to work a total of 1,500 to 1,800 hours over the year to earn those credits. <br><br>
                                    ECTS makes the educational process straightforward and transparent. It helps different universities understand and recognize other institutions' qualifications and study periods. This means that if you study abroad or transfer to a different university in the EU, you can carry over the credits you have already earned. The system ensures that your academic progress is recognized and valued, making it easier for you to move between different institutions while continuing your studies smoothly.<br><br>
                                    At E-Ascencia, courses are structured according to ECTS standards, ensuring the credits assigned reflect the expected workload and learning outcomes. Students expect each course to have clearly defined learning outcomes and workload requirements, ensuring a consistent and transparent educational experience.<br><br>
                                    By meticulously assigning and reviewing ECTS credits, E-Ascencia Malta supports student mobility, academic recognition, and flexible learning pathways within Europeâ€™s higher education framework.

                                    Modules and Awards are both used in education to recognize and certify learning achievements. However, they have some key differences. A module is a unit of study that usually runs for a set period of time (e.g., six weeks) and covers a specific topic or set of topics. It often involves classwork, assignments, and exams to assess the learner's understanding. Completing a module typically earns a certain number of credit points, which can be applied towards a degree. <br><br>
                                    Modules are the individual units of study within a program that focus on specific topics and contribute credits toward the qualification. <br><br>
                                    On the other hand, an award is a certificate that E-Ascencia provides to its students after they successfully complete a module. This award certifies that students have successfully completed a particular module on a specific date.
