                <ol type="i">
                  <li>Once you have logged into your Account, you will be able to enrol in an Online Course. To do so, select the desired Online Course and complete payment.</li>
                  <li>Prior to enrolling, please ensure you meet any prerequisites or entry requirements outlined on the Course Outline.</li>
                  <li>Online Courses may be subject to entry requirements, such as language proficiency or prior qualifications.   These entry requirements will be duly listed in the respective Course Outline.  If you have any doubts about your eligibility to enrol in an Online Course, please do not hesitate to contact us for clarification.</li>
                  <li>Your enrolment in an Online Course is contingent upon our verification that you meet the specific entry requirements set forth for each Online Course. As part of the enrolment process, you will be asked to provide supporting documentation as required. Your registration will not be considered complete until all requested documents have been submitted and verified by us. By submitting any supporting documentation, you warrant that they are true, genuine, and have not been altered in any way. Should discrepancies or issues with documentation arise, we reserve the right to take appropriate actions, including delaying, refusing or revoking your enrolment.</li>
                  <li>If we determine that you do not meet the entry requirements, we will notify you accordingly. You will be given an opportunity to present your case, except where we are prohibited from doing so. Any fees paid in advance will be refunded, although we reserve the right to charge an administrative fee to cover the time and effort spent in assessing your documentation.</li>

              <h3 class="mt-3 fw-bold mb-0 text-primary heading-title">6.	Payment</h3>
              <p>
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>We offer two payment options: full advance payment or quarterly payment.</li>
                  <li>The payment methods available from time to time, along with any associated charges, will be listed on our Portal.</li>
                  <li>Payment must be made in Euro.  You will be responsible for any charges associated with currency conversion.</li>
                  <li>You must pay the total course fees even if you do not complete your Online Course.  No refund of fees or release from financial commitment will be granted for the non-completion of studies.</li>
                  <li>If you enrolled to one of our Online Courses, you are legally entitled to cancel your enrolment, provided that the following conditions are met.</li>
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>If, after creating an Account and enrolling to an Online Course, you choose to access any associated Course Material, you will no longer be entitled to exercise such right to cancel.  This is because accessing the Course Material signifies the commencement of the service, and by doing so, you acknowledge that you forfeit your right to cancellation under our terms and conditions. This policy ensures that the value of the course is preserved and that all participants adhere to a fair usage agreement.  Hence, by accessing any Course Material at any time (even during the first 14-day period), you are losing and forfeiting the right to cancel (more commonly referred to as the right of withdrawal).</li>
                    <li>To cancel your enrolment, you need to inform us of your decision to withdraw from the contract within 14 days from the day when you made the order, by either</li>

                    </ol>
                    <li>You may use the following wording, but this is not mandatory (a simple email /letter notifying us that you want to cancel will be enough):</li>

                      <li>You are not required to give any reason for submitting such a cancellation.</li>
                      <li>When a cancellation request is validly received within the 14-day time frame indicated above, we will issue you a full refund for any payment received by us in relation to the Online Courses that you have cancelled.  The refund will be made without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you informed us about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement</li>

              <p>
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>The material and content that we will give you access to once you successfully enrol to an Online Course consists of (a) academic orientation sessions, (b) pre-recorded lectures, (c) animated videos, (d) podcasts, (e) guest interviews and/or panel interview and/or (f) readings (collectively “Course Material”).  Not all Online Courses will include all the aforementioned and thus, you are always encouraged to review carefully the respective Course Outline which will include a complete list of the Course Material that will be made available once you successfully enrol to that Online Course.</li>
                  <li>The Course Material will also include a curated selection of readings to complement your learning experience. This list will encompass references to books, journals, and other scholarly sources chosen specifically to enhance your understanding of course topics. However, it is important to note that we do not provide copies of these readings. Instead, you will be responsible for obtaining access to them independently.</li>
                  <li>Course Material will be made available to you based on your chosen payment method. If you opt for full advance payment, you will gain immediate access to all Online Course materials. Alternatively, if you choose to pay quarterly, access will be granted progressively, corresponding to each payment period.</li>
                  <li>The Course Material can only be accessed remotely through the Portal and only after you have successfully logged in to your Account. Course Material is made exclusively available for your personal and non-commercial use and are not to be shared with, or accessed by, any third party under any circumstances. To protect the integrity of our Course Material and prevent unauthorized sharing, access to Course Material is limited to three separate personal devices per registered user. Examples of such devices include personal computers, tablets, or smartphones.  Concurrent access to Course Material on multiple devices is not permitted. Only one device may be used at a time to access the Course Material, ensuring controlled use and preventing simultaneous logins from different locations.  Apart from certain documents which we will specifically indicate as being available for download, you will not be allowed to download, copy, save or otherwise store Course Material in any format. This includes any attempt to store these Course Material on any device or storage medium. Recording, broadcasting, or transmitting the content of the Course Material, including but not limited to audio, video, and digital content, through any means is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, screen recording, using recording devices, or any form of media capture.</li>
                  <li>We employ various measures to monitor and enforce these access restrictions and prohibitions. Any attempt to circumvent these rules, including device limitations, downloading, recording, or concurrent access restrictions, may result in legal action against you, immediate suspension or termination of your Account and your participation to the Online Course.</li>
                  <li>We may utilise third-party service providers (such as YouTube, Vimeo, and others) to enhance functionality and display content. Please note that availability of these services may vary by location and can be restricted in certain countries. It is your responsibility to ensure that you can access all content associated with our Online Courses, including that which is hosted on third-party platforms. Should you need detailed information about the specific service providers used, please contact us on <a href="mailto:info@eascencia.mt">info@eascencia.mt</a></li>
                  <li>You may be prevented from completing the Online Course or taking any assessments unless you thoroughly review and engage with all Course Material provided to you.  An Online Course may also include a specified number of contact hours, meaning that you will be required to spend a designated amount of time engaged in direct interaction with the Course Material.</li>
                  <li>You will have access to the Course Material for the expected duration of that respective Online Course, as set out in the Course Outline. Additionally, you will be granted a supplementary period equal to that initial expected duration for further review.  You thus acknowledge and understand that, once this period lapses, you will no longer have access to the Course Material.  Furthermore, please also note that access to the Course Material will be revoked if your Account is terminated, irrespective of how such termination occurs.</li>

              <p>
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>Each Online Course may include a variety of assessment methods to evaluate your understanding of the Course Material and your progress. These assessment methods may include, but are not limited to, quizzes, assignments, and/or exams. The specific types of assessments used, their frequency, and the criteria for passing will be clearly listed on the Course Outline.</li>
                  <li>To successfully complete an Online Course and receive a passing grade, you must meet the assessment criteria established for that course. These criteria will be detailed on the Course Outline and may vary from one course to another. Typically, these criteria will specify the minimum scores required on quizzes, assignments, and exams, and the different grades.</li>
                  <li>Certain Online Courses include a virtual exam as part of the assessment criteria. To maintain academic integrity and ensure a fair testing environment, these exams require that participants have their webcams turned on throughout the duration of the exam. This allows proctors to monitor exam conditions and verify the identity of the examinees.  You will be notified in advance about the specific proctoring methods to be used.  Detailed instructions on technical setup associated with the virtual exams, including supported operating systems, webcam specifications, and internet bandwidth requirements, will be included in the Course Outline or otherwise provided well in advance of the exam date.  You are solely responsible to test and confirm the functionality of your computer, webcam, and internet connection to ensure they meet the technical requirements specified for the virtual exam.</li>
                  <li>Participants are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity during the exam. Specific rules regarding permissible exam aids, communication with others, and other exam behaviour will be included in the Course Outline or communicated prior to the exam. Violations of exam policies may result in disciplinary actions, including but not limited to, the invalidation of exam results, disqualification from the Online Course and termination of your account.</li>
                  <li>Upon successful completion of an Online Course, including meeting all required assessment criteria, participants will be issued a Certificate of Achievement. This certificate will attest to the successful completion of the course and the attainment of the required competencies, including the grade.</li>
                  <li>If you complete all required activities for an Online Course but do not meet the passing criteria as outlined in the assessment requirements associated with that Online Course, you will not be eligible to receive a Certificate of Achievement. Instead, you will be issued a Certificate of Attendance, which acknowledges your participation in the Online Course.</li>
                  <li>Participants who do not pass the initial assessment(s) may be offered the opportunity to retake the failed assessment, depending on the specific course policies. Details regarding reassessment, including any potential costs, retake limits, and scheduling, will be provided on the Course Outline.  Unless the Course Outline stipulates otherwise, students are offered the opportunity to retake a failed assessment at no additional cost. Should a student fail this retake, a second opportunity is available for a fee. If the assessment is not passed after this second attempt, the student will be required to retake the entire module, which will also incur a fee.</li>
